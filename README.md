# Week 2 Challenge - My Portfolio

## Description  

I created this project as part of our Week 2 challenge to create our own portfolio. I wanted to create a web application to show off future projects of mine for potential employers. I also wanted to include some basic information about me, along with multiple ways to engage with me and/or contact me!  

When I'm applying for jobs in the future, I'll be able to use this portfolio as a resume to show off my developed applications to the employer.  

I learned a lot working on this project. We were given the building blocks to create a website from scratch, and I tried to use several techniques we learned, as well as expansions of those techniques - through research and troubleshooting - on this website.

## User Story  

AS AN employer  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position  

## Acceptance Critera  

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work  
WHEN I load their portfolio  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section  
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work  
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications  
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application  
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others  
WHEN I click on the images of the applications  
THEN I am taken to that deployed application  
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices  
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
